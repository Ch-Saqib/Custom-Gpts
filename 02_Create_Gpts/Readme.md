# Creating a Custom GPT

A detailed guide on creating a Custom GPT with OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

- **Subscription Requirement**: You need an OpenAI account with a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs are not available on free plans).

## Steps to Create a Custom GPT

1. **Access the GPT Builder**:
   - Direct Link: Visit [Creating a GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt).
   - From ChatGPT: If you're logged into ChatGPT, click on your username and select "My GPTs". From there, choose the option to "Create a GPT".

2. **Interact with the GPT Builder**:
   - The GPT Builder interface is conversational. Begin by describing the purpose of your custom GPT.

3. **Provide Core Details** (Create Tab):
   - **Name and Description**: Create a clear, descriptive name and brief explanation of your GPT’s function.

4. **Configure Your GPT** (Configure Tab):
   - **Profile Picture**: Upload your own image or use OpenAI’s DALLE-2 to generate one that reflects your GPT's purpose.
   - **Additional Instructions**: Refine your GPT’s behavior by providing instructions that define:
     - How it should respond and interact.
     - Specific tasks it should be able to perform.
     - Any behaviors to avoid.

5. **Fine-tune with Conversation Starters**:
   - Conversation starters are prompts that guide your GPT's responses in particular situations. Add new prompts or remove existing ones based on your needs.

   - **Perfect Instruction Writer**: [Perfect Instruction Tool](https://app.relevanceai.com/form/d7b62b/a7961ffd-5079-4cbf-a844-73ea03e8c8a0?hideLogo=true)

### Sharing and Publishing (Optional)

- **Private Access**: Your custom GPT is private by default and only accessible to you.
- **Sharing Options** (Top Right Corner):
  - **Anyone with the Link**: Allows other ChatGPT subscribers with the link to access your GPT.
  - **Public**: Publish your GPT to the GPT Store (coming soon), making it available to all users.

## Additional Tips

- **Explore Examples**: Browse the GPT Store (once available) for inspiration and examples of structured custom models.
- **Start Simple**: Begin with a clear, focused purpose and gradually add complexity.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Regular interaction and feedback can help your GPT learn and adapt to your requirements.

By following these steps and using the GPT Builder's features, you can create an OpenAI GPT tailored to your specific needs and interests.

## Tutorials

Here are some tutorials with examples of creating Custom GPTs:

- **Video Tutorial**: [How to Create Custom GPTs in 5 Minutes (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com). This video offers a concise walkthrough, creating a "Smith’s Solar Sales Assistant" GPT. It covers defining the GPT’s purpose, instructions, and adding custom actions for calculations.

- **Blog Post**: [How to Make Custom ChatGPT Models: 5 Easy Steps to Personalized GPTs (DataCamp)](https://www.datacamp.com). This post breaks down five core steps, helping you follow along with other example-based tutorials.

- **Additional Resources**: Exploring existing GPTs in the OpenAI GPT Store (once available) provides valuable examples. See how others have structured GPTs for various purposes, offering ideas for your own projects.

> **Key to Success**: Clearly define your GPT's purpose and provide specific instructions and examples. The tutorials above will help you get started with practical steps and illustrative examples.

## Drawbacks of Using a Custom GPT System

### Limited Access to User Interactions

- **Data Limitation**: Lack of access to user chat data limits fine-tuning based on real user interactions, making it challenging to adapt the model for diverse user types.

### Uncertain Model Accuracy

- **Lack of Feedback**: Without user data, assessing the accuracy or effectiveness of the model in practice is difficult.

### Challenges in Improving User Experience

- **Experience Enhancements**: Absence of user interaction data restricts improvements in the user experience.

### GUI Component Streaming

- **Alternative Solution**: GUI component streaming through Vercel SDK may be better suited than a custom GPT system for specific use cases.

### Message Limits for Free Users

- **Usage Restrictions**: Free users are limited to approximately 10 messages per day, with fluctuations based on the time of day. They are further limited to 3-5 messages every 5-6 hours, reducing usability. Additionally, one message is required as a starter prompt, leaving around 4 messages every 5 hours for interactions.
