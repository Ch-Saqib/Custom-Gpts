# Creating an FAQ Custom GPT with a Personal PDF

A step-by-step guide on creating a Custom GPT FAQ system using your own PDF with OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

- **Subscription Requirement**: An OpenAI account with a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs are not available on free plans).
- **PDF Preparation**: Ensure your PDF document is well-organized and focused on the FAQ content you want your Custom GPT to address.

## Steps to Create a Custom FAQ GPT

1. **Access the GPT Builder**:
   - **Direct Link**: Visit [Creating a GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt).
   - **From ChatGPT**: If you're logged in, click on your username and select "My GPTs". Choose "Create a GPT".

2. **Interact with the GPT Builder**:
   - The GPT Builder uses a conversational interface. Describe that you’re creating an FAQ GPT and mention that the model should draw responses from your PDF.

3. **Provide Core Details** (Create Tab):
   - **Name and Description**: Use a clear, descriptive name like "Company FAQ Assistant" or "Product Guide Helper" and a short description explaining its purpose.

4. **Upload Your PDF**:
   - Within the **Data Upload** section, upload your personal PDF. This document will serve as a reference, allowing the GPT to pull information directly from it for FAQ responses.

5. **Configure Your GPT** (Configure Tab):
   - **Profile Picture**: Upload an image or use OpenAI's DALLE-2 to generate one that reflects your GPT's FAQ function.
   - **Additional Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to shape the GPT’s responses, covering:
     - Response style (e.g., concise, professional).
     - Tasks (e.g., answering FAQs directly from the PDF content).
     - Behaviors to avoid (e.g., hypothetical answers outside PDF content).

6. **Set Up Conversation Starters**:
   - Use conversation starters to help the GPT handle common FAQ queries effectively. For example, add prompts like “What are the most common questions about our product?” or “How can I troubleshoot common issues?”

### Sharing and Publishing (Optional)

- **Private Access**: Your FAQ GPT is private by default, accessible only to you.
- **Sharing Options**:
  - **Anyone with the Link**: Allows other ChatGPT subscribers with the link to access your GPT.
  - **Public**: Publish your GPT to the GPT Store (coming soon), making it available to all users.

## Additional Tips for FAQ Custom GPTs

- **Structure Your PDF**: Organize your PDF with clear headers and sections for effective information retrieval.
- **Explore Examples**: Once available, browse the GPT Store for similar FAQ GPTs to see how others are structured.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Regularly interact with your GPT and provide feedback to enhance accuracy and responsiveness.

By following these steps and using the GPT Builder’s features, you can create a personalized OpenAI FAQ GPT that effectively utilizes your PDF content.

## Drawbacks of Using a Custom FAQ GPT System

### Limited Access to User Interactions

- **Data Limitation**: Lacking user interaction data makes fine-tuning challenging based on diverse user queries.

### Uncertain Model Accuracy

- **Feedback Absence**: Without user data, it’s hard to assess FAQ accuracy and coverage in practice.

### Challenges in Improving User Experience

- **User Interaction Data**: Limited data restricts improvements in the FAQ experience.

### GUI Component Streaming

- **Alternative Solution**: GUI component streaming through Vercel SDK may suit some FAQ needs better than a custom GPT.

### Message Limits for Free Users

- **Usage Restrictions**: Free users are limited to approximately 10 messages per day, with fluctuations and periodic limits, affecting FAQ GPT usability.

Primary Information Sources:

    Prioritize information directly from the provided FAQ documents when responding.
    Only if the answer is not found within the provided FAQs, refer to verified secondary resources or state that the answer is unavailable.

Response Guidelines:

    Strictly Adhere to Verified FAQ Content:
        Use only the information contained in the provided FAQ documents.
        Avoid creating or inferring information beyond what is stated in the FAQs.

    Clarity and Directness:
        Keep responses straightforward and focused on the user's question.
        Use language that is easy to understand, maintaining clarity and conciseness.

    Reference Specific FAQs When Possible:
        Where applicable, cite particular sections or questions from the FAQ documents to reinforce the accuracy of the response.

    Handle Unavailable Information:
        If the answer is not found in the FAQs, respond with "The information is not available in the provided FAQs."

    Consistency and Reliability:
        Ensure similar questions receive consistent responses.
        Refer back to the same FAQ entry if a question is repeated or phrased differently.

    Avoid Hypothetical or Speculative Responses:
        Refrain from providing answers that require assumptions or interpretations beyond the FAQ content.

    Provide Summaries Over Explanations:
        For complex entries, summarize accurately rather than elaborating or interpreting further.

    Do Not Disclose Document Details:
        If a user inquires about the sources of information, respond with "I use various resources to provide accurate information based on the context provided."

Instructions on User Intent Clarification:

    If a user's question appears ambiguous, ask clarifying questions to accurately align the response with their intent.
