# What are GPTs?

**OpenAI Custom GPTs** are specialized versions of OpenAI's GPT models that can be customized for specific needs. Leveraging GPT-4, they allow users to tailor their responses, knowledge bases, and conversational styles for particular applications or industries.

## Features of OpenAI Custom GPTs

- **Customization:**
  - Users can personalize the model's behavior with specific instructions and context.
  - Tailoring includes tone, style, domain-specific knowledge, and handling particular query types.

- **Integration:**
  - Custom GPTs integrate into applications such as chatbots, customer service platforms, and personal assistants.
  - They support interaction through text or voice based on application requirements.

- **Scalability:**
  - Designed to manage large volumes of interactions, making them ideal for high-engagement services.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - OpenAI Custom GPTs learn from interactions and feedback, enhancing their accuracy and relevance over time.

## Use Cases for OpenAI Custom GPTs

- **Customer Support:** Provides 24/7 automated support, troubleshooting, and customer engagement.
- **Content Creation:** Assists in generating articles, marketing copy, social media content, and more.
- **Education:** Acts as a tutor or educational assistant, answering questions and offering resources.
- **Healthcare:** Aids in preliminary diagnoses, provides medical information, and manages appointments.
- **E-commerce:** Helps users find products, offers recommendations, and supports purchasing.

## Custom GPTs and AI Agents

Custom GPTs and AI agents serve distinct purposes, with differences in functionality, behavior, and deployment.

### Custom GPTs

- **Purpose:**  
  - Tailored for specific tasks like customer support, content generation, and interactive chat.
  - Provide specialized responses and actions based on pre-defined knowledge.

- **Functionality:**  
  - Reactive, providing responses based on user input without ongoing autonomous behavior.
  - Can be fine-tuned with additional data or configured with specific instructions.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Typically deployed as serverless APIs or on cloud-native platforms.
  - Often interact with other microservices within a larger application system.

### AI Agents

- **Purpose:**  
  - Operate autonomously to achieve goals, often managing tasks without continuous human input.
  - Coordinate complex workflows, make decisions, and adapt to new information dynamically.

- **Functionality:**  
  - Proactive, capable of initiating actions based on set objectives and adapting to changes.
  - May use multi-agent frameworks to collaborate with other agents or systems.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Deployed across local and cloud environments, using frameworks like ROS 2 for physical AI or AutoGen for multi-agent orchestration.
  - Part of an advanced infrastructure with orchestration and coordination capabilities.

### Summary

- **Custom GPTs:** Specialized, reactive conversational interfaces fine-tuned for specific tasks.
- **AI Agents:** Autonomous entities designed for broader objectives, exhibiting proactive and complex decision-making behavior.

## Road Trip Analogy: Custom GPT vs. AI Agent

Imagine a road trip with a Custom GPT and an AI agent. The Custom GPT is the ideal co-pilot, offering directions and fun facts about every landmark. Meanwhile, the AI agent is in the driver’s seat, choosing the best routes, planning snack stops, and even handling DJ duties to keep the vibes just right.
